What's new in this release?
</p>

<p>
<b>Support for Groups</b>
</p>
<p>
Contacts now supports the collection of contacts into named groups.  Groups are displayed in the contact list.
When a web page asks for access to your contacts, you may now restrict access to one, or some, of your groups.
A contact can belong to any number of groups.
</p>

<p>
The groups that Contacts displays are imported from your contact sources; if you have groups set up in your
Google contact list, or your native address book application, they will be imported.  Firefox Contacts will
also automatically create a group for each of your contact services.
</p>

<p>
If you use exactly the same name for a group on two or more services, the groups will be combined.
</p>

<p>
<b>Support for OAuth logins</b>
</p>
<p>
Where possible, Contacts now uses the industry-standard OAuth login mechanism to access websites.  You will
need to re-connect your browser to your services once to set it up.
</p>

<p>
<b>Support for merge and split operations</b>
</p>
<p>
The Contact manager now allows you to merge records from different services that represent the same person,
or to split records that were automatically merged.
</p>

<p>
<b>Last.fm integration</b>
</p>

<p>
Contacts can import friend lists from Last.fm.
</p>

<p>
<b>"Export" command</b>
</p>

<p>
Contacts can export the unified list of contacts as a VCard file for use in other applications.
</p>

<p>
<b>Javascript API documentation</b>
</p>

<p>
Documentation for the Contacts API is now <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Contacts/ContentAPI">posted on our site</a>.  Web developers are encouraged to
experiment with it and provide feedback.
</p>

<p>
<b>Experimental "services" API</b>
</p>

<p>
An opt-in service integration API is included as an experiment.  Developers can read about it and how to enable it
for experimental hacking <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Labs/Contacts/ContentAPI#Experimental_.22Services.22_API">here</a>.

<p><b>Release Notes:</b></p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Visual refresh with new styling.</li>

<li>Support for Groups.  The Portable Contacts "tags" attribute is used to construct a list of groups; each contact may
belong to as many groups as desired.  Each importer automatically adds its own name as a tag.</li>

<li>Support for OAuth login for many contact services through the OAuthorizer library.  This also involved changing the
GMail importer from VCard to the Google Contacts API.</li>

<li>Reworked web content permission dialog.  The user is prompted to select groups of contacts to make available
to web content.</li>

<li>When permission is granted to a website, the permission is saved until Firefox leaves that page.  If the "Remember" checkbox
is checked, it is saved across multiple runs of Firefox.</li>

<li>Reworked internal database format to support merge and split operations.  Merge and split should correctly
persist across refreshes of a service.</li>

<li>Improved performance of contact discovery services.</li>

<li>Support for postal address and group import from Mac address book.</li>

<li>Support for "callto:" protocol for phone numbers.</li>
